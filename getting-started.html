            <h3>How to get started</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with <a href="./index.html">bouldering is surprisingly
                    simple</a>. All you need are
                some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first
                sessions. No prior experience or complex gear required!</p>

                <h4>Know Before You Go</h4>
                <p>
                    Before you start climbing, learn proper falling technique and always check your landing zone. Taking
                    basic safety precautions and learning gym etiquette will help ensure a fun and injury-free
                    experience.</p>
